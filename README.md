# Overview
This project explores Augmented Reality (AR) using ArUco markers for seamlessly integrating posters into real-world scenes. The goal is to detect ArUco markers within images, apply perspective transformations, and overlay posters realistically.

# Key Steps Involved:
Detecting ArUco Markers using OpenCV.
Performing Perspective Transformation to align images.
Warping the Poster Image to fit the detected marker.
Masking and Bitwise Operations to blend the poster into the scene.
Evaluating the Results for proper alignment and realism.

# Results & Observations:
Many poster images were perfectly aligned with the ArUco markers.
Some misalignments occurred due to poor marker detection, perspective distortion, and environmental conditions.

Conclusion:
The project successfully demonstrated precise AR-based image overlay using OpenCV and ArUco markers. However, improvements in marker detection and perspective adjustments could enhance accuracy further.
